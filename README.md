# Overview

I made this recipe React web app so that I can learn how to use React. This was a great way to familiarize myself with React Hooks and JSX.

This app pulls from the Edamam Recipe Search API and takes input on what ingredient the user wants to search. It also allows users to save recipes and saves it to localstorage.

In my day to day life, I find that I often have food in my fridge or pantry that I have no use for. Often this food rots because I do not what to do with it. I decided to make a web app that helps me find recipes with the ingredients that I have.

# Web Pages
The first screen automatically searches for recipes using chicken. The page dynamically changes the recipes that are displayed based on the input that the user gives it.

 The second section is Saved. If a User clicks a bookmark on a recipe, it will go to the Saved page and be put into localstorage.
